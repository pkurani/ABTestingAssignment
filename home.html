            A/B Testing for Cactuses
         </h1>
         <p>
            For too long, the cactus industry has been hampered by their inability to make a website that appeals to users. In the context of the websites being discussed, Version B is extremely similar to version B, expect each product has a green background, and the spaces between products are greatly increased. Here, we will be testing 2 iterations of a potential cactus ordering websits to see if we can choose the best website for selling cactuses!
         </p>
         <p>
            The task: Users are instructed to put $150 of cacti into their cart.

            Creating Hypotheses
         </h2>
         <p> In this section, we will be creating and describing the null and alternative hypothesis for two key metrics: Time to Completion and Return Rate</p>
         <h3>
            Time to Completion
         </h3>
         <ul>
            <li><b>Null hypothesis</b> - there is no significant difference in rate of return, as there are no major differenes in regards to the functionality of the websites.</li>
            <li><b>Alternative hypothesis</b> - Users on site B would take a greater amount of time completing their tasks, as the size of the content is enlarged -- thus increasing the amount of time it takes the user to scroll through the page and increase the distance between the "Add to Cart" buttons</li>
         </ul>
         <h3>
            Return Rate
         </h3>
         <ul>
            <li><b>Null hypothesis</b> - there is no significant difference in the time completion, as there are no major differenes in regards to the functionality of the websites.</li>
            <li><b>Alternative hypothesis</b> -  Users on site B would have a lower rate of return due to the fact that the green, divided backgrounds for each cactus forces the user to spend more time reading the discription and price, making the selections more memorable and decreasing the chance that they second guess themselves when they access the cart. </li>
         </ul>
      </div>

         <h2>
            Collecting Data
         </h2>
         <p>I collected data for the website primarily through the weekly studios, and also by sending the link to some of my peers and informing them of the directions. Once I recieved the log files, I converted them into a csv file and cleaned out the data, leaving me with 20 unique sessions between both versions A and B.</p>

      <h2>
         Key Conclusions
      </h2>
      <ul>
         <li>Overall, I really enjoyed this project. I think the process of building two websites for the same product, deplyoing the websites, interpreting the logs, and running statistical tests on the results not only gave me insight on how to perfect the user experience when building websites that people interact with, but it also gave me an idea
            as to what an iterative process in developing user-facing sites and products looks like
         </li>
         <li>I think a big limitation of this process was the lack of users. I think with a larger testing sample, the averages and numbers for the two sets would look very similar, as the functionality of the websites are not that different
         </li>
         <li>This process also made me realize how important it is to collect a wide number of numbers. While time to completion and return rate are great, I think I could make larger improvements to the website in the future if I focused on information such as time between user clicks, "scroll location" of user, etc</li>
         <li>Finally, I think the results of this particular A/B test displayed the importance of having all products for a particular webpage on a single "screen" at once. As evidenced by the increase in time to completion and return rate associated with version B; having all the information avaliable to be seen without requiring the user to scroll not only allows for a faster time to completion, but also allows
            for greater memorability, as the user has all the information avalibale right in front of them
         </li>
      </ul>
